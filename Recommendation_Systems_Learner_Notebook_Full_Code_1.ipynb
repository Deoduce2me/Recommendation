    "# **Project: Amazon Product Recommendation System**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the project on Recommendation Systems. We will work with the Amazon product reviews dataset for this project. The dataset contains ratings of different electronic products. It does not include information about the products or reviews to avoid bias while building the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "## **Context:**\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, information is growing exponentially with volume, velocity and variety throughout the globe. This has lead to information overload, and too many choices for the consumer of any business. It represents a real dilemma for these consumers and they often turn to denial. Recommender Systems are one of the best tools that help recommending products to consumers while they are browsing online. Providing personalized recommendations which is most relevant for the user is what's most likely to keep them engaged and help business. \n",
    "\n",
    "E-commerce websites like Amazon, Walmart, Target and Etsy use different recommendation models to provide personalized suggestions to different users. These companies spend millions of dollars to come up with algorithmic techniques that can provide personalized recommendations to their users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon, for example, is well-known for its accurate selection of recommendations in its online site. Amazon's recommendation system is capable of intelligently analyzing and predicting customers' shopping preferences in order to offer them a list of recommended products. Amazon's recommendation algorithm is therefore a key element in using AI to improve the personalization of its website. For example, one of the baseline recommendation models that Amazon uses is item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "## **Objective:**\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a Data Science Manager at Amazon, and have been given the task of building a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products. You have a collection of labeled data of Amazon reviews of products. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and build a recommendation system that helps in recommending products to online consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "## **Dataset:** \n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The Amazon dataset contains the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **userId:** Every user identified with a unique id\n",
    "- **productId:** Every product identified with a unique id\n",
    "- **Rating:** The rating of the corresponding product by the corresponding user\n",
    "- **timestamp:** Time of the rating. We **will not use this column** to solve the current problem"

    "- The count indicates that there are 65,290 ratings available in the dataset.\n",
    "- The mean rating is approximately 4.295, suggesting that, on average, the users have given ratings close to 4.3.\n",
    "- The standard deviation of 0.989 indicates that the ratings are relatively spread out around the mean, with a moderate level of variability.\n",
    "- The minimum rating is 1.0, indicating that the users have provided ratings as low as 1.\n",
    "- The quartiles (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles) provide information about the distribution of ratings. The 25th percentile is 4, indicating that 25% of the ratings fall below 4. The median (50th percentile) is 5, indicating that 50% of the ratings fall below 5. The 75th percentile is also 5, suggesting that 75% of the ratings fall below 5.\n",
    "- The maximum rating is 5, which is the highest possible rating in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the ratings seem to be negatively skewed, with a majority of ratings falling towards the higher end (4 and 5), as the median (50th percentile) is higher than the mean, and the 25th percentile is lower than the median. This indicates that there is a longer left tail in the ratings distribution, pulling the mean towards the lower ratings."

    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this conversation, we explored three different recommendation models: user-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative filtering, and matrix factorization (SVD). We discussed their implementation, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics. Here are the key findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- User-based Collaborative Filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Achieved an RMSE of 0.9950 and a precision of 0.838 for the optimized model.\n",
    "    - Made predictions for both interacted and non-interacted products.\n",
    "- Item-based Collaborative Filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Achieved an RMSE of 0.9576 and a precision of 0.839 for the optimized model.\n",
    "    - Made predictions for both interacted and non-interacted products.\n",
    "- Matrix Factorization (SVD):\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Achieved an RMSE of 0.8808 and a precision of 0.854 for the optimized model.\n",
    "    - Made predictions for both interacted and non-interacted products.\n",
    "### Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on the evaluation metrics, the matrix factorization model (SVD) performed the best with the lowest RMSE and higher precision. It takes into account latent features and provides personalized recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When using collaborative filtering, both user-based and item-based approaches can be effective, depending on the dataset and specific use case. It is recommended to try both approaches and compare their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search cross-validation can significantly improve the performance of recommendation models. It helps in finding the optimal values for hyperparameters and leads to better predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is important to evaluate the recommendation models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as RMSE, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy, relevance, and performance of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continuously updating and refining the recommendation models based on user feedback and new data can lead to better recommendations and improved user satisfaction."
